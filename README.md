### GrabAiSea_Safety

## General Idea
Converted telematics data to graphs. The graphs are then fed into CNN for modelling and prediction.

## Directory Structure

# 1. model_150_50.h5 
Used for prediction (tensorflow)

# 2. manual_confusion_matrix (tensorflow-gpu
Contains result of the tensor model. Prediction and ROC done based on Neural Network

# 3. Grab_Preprocessing
Python notebook for preprocessing

# 4. KMeans.ipynb
KMeans.ipynb

# 5. Grab Simple (ML).ipynb
Prediction and ROC done based on Random Forest.
